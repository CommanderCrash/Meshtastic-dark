# Meshtastic-dark
Added fetures i want to meshtastic android app. This is a work in progress.

1. Remove traceroute timeout limit
2. Remove Ignore limit from 3 and change it to unlimited
3. Add filter checkbox when checked will only receive DM's/PM's from that node
4. Mute will not show messages in the channle if channle is muted.
5. Provide location to mesh checkbox off by default.
6. Remove Anonymous usage and crash reports for this build.

I'm not taking credit for the app; I'm just modifying it. All devs' credits will still be there. However, each time I bring up an issue, it is turned around by other devs or moderators as nothing. This is real bad behavior for any open-source development group.
